              "['Her Majesty The Queen’s New Year Address 2019.Another year has gone by. 2019 lies behind us now with all that it brought us: memories that will endure, good as well as sad ones, and challenges we had to take on, difficult as well as stimulating ones.This year, it is 50 years ago that man landed on the moon, and we were able to see our own planet, Earth, as a small globe in outer space: quite alone, but so beautiful and round and blue - the blue planet where we belong. For us here in Denmark, it is perhaps not so surprising that the planet is blue. After all, we have the sea in front of us and the blue sky above us.Regardless of how grand and varied it may seem, our Earth is vulnerable. We are in the process of realising that, and it gives rise to concern, not least among many young people who see the climate change effects that are clearly visible these years. We have a shared responsibility for our beautiful globe, so teeming with life. It is an essential challenge to us all today, and it is important that we all pay attention to how we live and what actions we take.In our age, a feeling has emerged which may be difficult to talk about. However, we must put it into words in order to defeat it.Loneliness: it is a feeling that many experience. Not only socially vulnerable people. Also elderly people who see their spouses or their contemporaries pass away – what happened to them, all those who used to fill everyday life. But also children and very young people may experience loneliness. Who wants to play with me? Who can I talk to? Not just on Facebook, but in real life: face to face, in private with a friend of the same age or with someone who is older and who one can confide in. Someone to share one’s thoughts with.We need to talk together, also about loneliness. We need each other. We need to have it confirmed that we matter.2020 will be a year with a great many things to remember. On 9 April, it is 80 years ago that Denmark was occupied. An event that came to influence all those who experienced it, and which has left deep traces in the consciousness of Denmark. Five years passed. But then the Liberation came on 4 and 5 May 1945. It filled everybody with euphoric joy, which was also felt by those who like me were only five years old. But not all could share in the joy, for the Island of Bornholm was subjected to heavy bombardment that left the towns of Rønne and Nexø badly damaged and resulted in a tragic loss of civilian lives.It is a long time ago, and those who experienced the events of the time have almost all passed away. Nevertheless, it is five years that continue to be remembered, also with pride, for the spirit of solidarity and self-sacrifice that showed what we in Denmark are capable of. We must continue to stand guard over the values we fought for and which remain the foundation of our society. It is disgraceful to see how anti-Semitism raises its ugly head once again, also here in our country. Anti-Semitism, intolerance and repression of people who think differently – it has no place in our society. This is something we must pay close attention to, and which we must help each other to counter.On 10 July, we shall celebrate the centenary of the Reunification of South Jutland with Denmark. Reunification Day became a landmark day, not just for the people of South Jutland but a day that involved all the people of Denmark. In the thousands, from all over the country, people flocked south to see King Christian X ride across the border on the white horse. Many may feel today that it is a distant event, but ask the people of South Jutland: they know that a page was turned in the history of Denmark on that day. It will be fine for us to celebrate that when we reach the anniversary, and we will celebrate it.In late summer, I visited Schleswig-Holstein where I received a warm and festive welcome, which contributed to confirming the strong neighbourly relations and good friendship between Germany and Denmark.It also became an unforgettable meeting with the Danish minority.You did not come home to Denmark 100 years ago. However, Denmark is and will continue to be the country of your heart. I was moved to hear that, also from the young generation. I shall never forget that!It is thanks to both the Danish minority in Germany and the German minority in Denmark that the border country has developed so harmoniously and peacefully over the years. It has come to serve as a model for the rest of the world. I send my warm New Year greetings to everybody in the border country.While the ice around Greenland is loosening its grip, the world’s attention is increasingly turning towards the country in the high north. That country and its people are very close to me and the heart of my family. We always follow events and developments in Greenland, and you are in our thoughts, both when there are difficulties and when you address the problems with confidence. I wish everybody in Greenland a good and happy New Year.My thoughts also go to the Faroe Islands on the last evening of the year. Also from there, my family and I have warm and good memories. With tireless persistence you have managed to overcome many of the difficulties facing a society that is geographically isolated and exposed to the forces of nature. I send my heartfelt New Year wishes to everybody in the Faroe Islands.Under distant skies, our Danish soldiers who are posted abroad contribute to freedom and stability. We must remember that on this evening when they are particularly missed at home.I send my warmest greetings and good wishes for the new year to all who are posted abroad and to their families.It is not only in other countries that Danes are on duty. My New Year greetings go to everybody in the defence, the emergency management services, the police, the health care sector and all others who are at work this evening and tonight. Men and women who all attend to their duties while others are off work and can celebrate New Year safely and securely.Wherever in the world one goes, one will encounter Danes. In spring, I visited Argentina. Also in that country there are many who have Danish roots and who hold on to this heritage. To them and to all others with Danish roots, wherever in the world they are, I send my New Year wishes with a “thank you” for their loyalty to the old country.Every day, my big family makes me happy and proud. The Crown Prince and the Crown Princess have plenty to do, and at the same time they manage to create a warm home for their four children.Prince Joachim and Princess Marie together with their two children are in Paris, where Prince Joachim is receiving additional training at the French military academy. At the same time, I have enjoyed watching his talks about Danish history on TV. I knew he would be good at it.In the new year, Prince Christian’s confirmation will take place. He will soon be a young man with life ahead of him. I shall celebrate my 80th birthday. I have many years behind me.I am grateful for all that the years bring me, and for all the warmth that I and all my family continue to be met with. It is a source of inspiration as well as an obligation.We are standing at the door of the year 2020.We do not know yet what it will bring. We open the door a little, it is like making a new acquaintance with new opportunities. We all have plans, big and not so big plans, and wishes, more or less attainable wishes. Let us enter the new year together. I wish everybody a happy New Year. May it become a good year for Denmark.GOD BLESS DENMARK',\n",
              " 'Her Majesty The Queen’s New Year Address 2018.It is New Year’s Eve once again!When the clock strikes twelve at midnight, the old year comes to an end. At that very moment, we toast the new year and wish each other “Happy New Year”.On New Year’s Morning, we wake up to embrace new days. They lie ahead of us, waiting for us, but the time that has passed lies behind us.And yet – all the things that happen to us leave an impact and provide us with experience, good and not so good. We must carry that experience with us further in life.These years we are witnessing economic progress in Denmark. Our companies feel it, the Danes feel it and are steaming ahead. Economically, Denmark is doing very well, but we must also take the time to consider what this good fortune is doing for us and doing to us. Is economic progress also translated into social progress?Our country is becoming richer. But are our lives becoming richer?Many people experience that the pace of day-to-day life has increased, also more than all can keep up with. There is so much that needs to be done, both at work and during leisure time. Perhaps we create some of the demands ourselves. We do not want to miss out on anything – we want it all, and preferably at the same time.In our hurry we may become too keen on being in the limelight. It is as if more people say, “look at me” and fewer have an eye for others.I fear that reflection and consideration may be pushed back and forgotten.New technology has created altogether new opportunities for contact with others. It is possible to FaceTime with one’s children and grandchildren even though they are on the other side of the globe; it is a source of great joy to all parties. \\xa0However, new technology may also result in the contact becoming more impersonal – we are “online” all the time – and we forget that, actually, there is a human being at the other end. It is so easy to write a comment or share a photo on social media that may be offensive and leave deep scars. That sort of thing goes into cyberspace, spreading like swarms of flies.I find there is a tendency that our way of spending time together becomes more superficial, less attentive. We do not take the time to understand each other and we forget to respect each other and take care of each other.It also affects our children.There are probably some children who are also watching tonight?To you I would like to say a few words:The important thing is not how you look or what you have achieved. But who you are and how you behave towards others – your friends and schoolmates; if you are so busy achieving what is best for yourself all the time, you fail to see how others are doing. \\xa0You need to take the time to notice if a friend is unhappy. There must be time to understand if you have said something that hurts a friend, or you have teased someone too much. It is important to patch things up again then.This does not apply to children only; we who are adults should also bear it in mind.Trust develops when we meet person-to-person and speak with each other.We may well disagree. We are entitled to that. It is part of reflecting and forming an opinion. But we must always listen to each other and try to understand each other.This applies throughout our society.Our common strength is nurtured when we feel respect for our fellow human beings and place trust in each other, for we all have a responsibility for the community. This is the very roots of our society.If the roots are not healthy, the tree cannot stand, and it will take many years for a new tree to grow tall and strong.Therefore, it is serious if people who represent an important part of our society take their responsibility too lightly and fail to meet their obligations. Is this something we have seen recently?Those entrusted with high positions carry a special responsibility and a special duty to do their best where they are placed.It makes me very sad if morals decline. What is to become of common decency then? We must be able to distinguish between what is yours and mine, between right and wrong. It ought not to be that difficult.It is a matter of concern to more and more people that our lifestyle affects the environment and climate change.Companies have green strategies, Wind, sun and biomass provide us with cleaner energy. At home in the kitchen we sort waste. Many buy organic products.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It is probably the young who are leading the way. They understand that the problems of the future will become theirs. They - unlike us older people - do not want to get stuck in old habits.Therefore, we must listen attentively to the young when we discuss how to avoid challenging the balance of nature.We must give consideration to the future. \\xa0We must give the future careful thought in time. \\xa0In Greenland the ice is melting. There, the changes are also conspicuous.There, in the high north, people live close to nature. Wind and weather, snow and ice are something all are dependent on throughout the year. These years, nature is generous. The fishing industry is doing well. That generates progress.It is my hope that the good development in Greenland will continue, and that this vast country will become better integrated and more closely linked to Denmark and the world at large.I send my warmest New Year greetings to everybody in Greenland.This summer the Crown Prince and the Crown Princess together with their four children visited the Faroe Islands.They encountered a modern society with high growth and development, but also a people that is aware of who they themselves are. Faroese people are characterised by a directness, hospitality and warmth that I remember from the visits Prince Henrik and I paid to the country.Tonight, I wish to say a big thank you to everybody who contributed to making the visit to the Faroe Islands a unique experience for the Crown Prince, the Crown Princess and their children.I wish everybody in the Faroe Islands a happy New Year.I send special New Year greetings to the Danish minority in South Schleswig.There, Danish culture and language live in peaceful co-existence with the German majority. In a world where so many border regions are characterised by conflicts of interest and sharp viewpoints, exactly this region serves as a fine example which both Danish and German institutions and associations can be proud of.Tonight, my thoughts also go to the Danish soldiers, police officers and specialists who are posted abroad. There are not so many this year, but they matter, each and every one of them in the places where they serve, in countries like Iraq, Afghanistan, Kosovo, and the Baltic States. They are missed at home. We think of them and wish them a happy New Year.I also send my New Year greetings to all Danes who live outside Denmark. Regardless of whether they are staying abroad for a short while or have settled, perhaps for good, they contribute to representing Denmark.It is far from all who are off duty tonight.Here in Denmark, the Emergency Management Agency, the Police, the Defence and the Fire Brigade are on duty. They see to it that the rest of us can celebrate the new year safely and securely.On buses and in taxis, on trains and planes, and on-board ships, it is not possible to be off duty on such a New Year’s Eve. Also, many are on duty at hospitals, nursing homes, and other institutions where they make sure that New Year’s Eve is safe and festive. Many volunteers choose to hold the New Year celebrations at hostels and other shelters where they turn up to make the evening festive for those who are most alone and find life hard.I send New Year greetings to the many who are working for us all tonight.I cannot look back at the year that has passed without mentioning the death of Prince Henrik. We spent 50 years together, we had two sons, and eight grandchildren have been added to the family – we were given all that, and much more. The warm sympathy shown us, and the understanding of Prince Henrik’s contribution which was so beautifully expressed by everybody in Denmark upon his demise have warmed the hearts of us all, including his family in France. Once again, I wish to express my deep-felt gratitude.Crown Prince Frederik celebrated his 50th birthday this year. He decided to celebrate it in quite his own way. A big thank you to the many thousands, both grown-ups and children, who participated in the Royal Run, either by running the route or – like myself – by cheering on the runners.It was a fine day that made him both happy and grateful, and which made me so proud.The Crown Prince, the Crown Princess, Prince Joachim and Princess Marie and my eight wonderful grandchildren together with me have so much to say thanks for. We all feel the warm support which we encounter everywhere, on special occasions, as well as in day-to-day life.Life brings us both sorrows and joys.Let us welcome the new year with reflection and consideration. Let us carry our experience – good and not so good – into the new year and let us embrace the year in a spirit of hope and confidence.I wish you all a happy New Year!\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 GOD BLESS DENMARK',\n",
              " 'Her Majesty The Queen’s New Year Address 2017.It is New Year’s Eve now – once again!It seems as if time goes by faster and faster as we get on in years. It was different when we were children: It took forever, from getting up in the morning of Christmas Eve until we could finally gather around the Christmas tree. The days between Christmas and New Year were full of life and activity, but on New Year’s Eve time dragged again until we could listen to the bells of the Copenhagen City Hall, and the whole city exploded in fireworks and golden rain.One of the things that make this time of the year so very special is probably the joy of expectation: The joy of being able to be together, the joy of looking forward to a new year with new hope and renewed strength. However, the year that has passed may also have held hard times – not everything is a source of joy for all of us.People are different, and Denmark needs different people with their individual abilities and talents, their lines of activity.One person is a number cruncher, another knows all about technology. One person is good at attracting customers or setting up a business. Some have the talent of teaching whereas others have an ability to care for children and the elderly or the sick. Others prefer to bury themselves in books and see how the world opens from there. Some are so good with their hands that it is almost incredible how they do it.No one talent is better or grander than another, we need all of it and for all of us.We do what we can, each and every one of us. In Denmark, we have shaken off the economic crisis through joint effort. There is vibrant activity throughout the country.In times of economic growth, we need the efforts of everybody, indeed of more people than we ourselves have. Throughout history, we have brought skilful hands and clever heads to Denmark from other countries. Many people have come to Denmark in order to work here. We needed them in the past and we still need them! They may be employees in agriculture, at hotels and restaurants, or highly specialised researchers whose knowledge is needed.It is not merely a question of being short of hands. We also need ideas and inspiration from abroad in order to maintain the high position which Denmark holds in so many fields, in the same way as we succeed in inspiring others throughout the world.Denmark’s good reputation is due to both our traditions and the innovation that every generation has brought with it. We will not be bowled over, we will stay true to ourselves as we have always done here in Denmark.Much has changed since my contemporaries and I were children or young people. But the keynote remains rooted in a culture and a way of life that has emerged and grown here in our country.It is a reflection of who we are and of what is important to us as a country and as Danes.Perhaps we sometimes forget to ask ourselves what is most important in life.In our day-to-day lives, many hours of the day are filled with work and duties. But what matters most to us, at the end of the day?The people that are close to us, they matter most. And to most of us, they are our family.A family is not necessarily the same today as it was a generation ago. I think a recognition has emerged that not all families consist of father, mother and children. There is more variety today, but also more broad-mindedness and tolerance.When there are more possibilities, there are also more choices. That is in principle a step forward. But we may also lose our bearings when faced with all the possibilities.In a modern family there are a huge number of tasks to perform. I sometimes wonder how parents manage to find the time to take their little boy to his swimming lesson, and pick up his big sister at a friend’s before they themselves have to attend a course. How do they manage to get it all done?Our day-to-day lives are full of demands that must be met and choices that must be made.It may look as if all doors are open to us. But one person cannot enter all the doors at the same time.I do not believe it is possible to take an interest in everything.Tonight, I have a small suggestion to make: That we sometimes do something different from what we usually do. Something beyond the practical tasks of everyday life.That we try and do something that is not necessary, something that there is no need for, something pointless!\\xa0It will not be the same thing for everybody. Some prefer going for a walk in the woods or along the beach. Others would rather listen to music or watch a TV series. Personally, I prefer doing something with my hands – a piece of needlework, a sketchpad; something with colours.I think it is important to have experiences that appeal to our senses, something that inspires our imagination, that stimulates the mind, and that can enlarge our world.That is not so pointless after all.Every country’s distinctiveness is a reflection of its nature. The Kingdom of Denmark comprises three countries: Denmark, the Faroe Islands and Greenland, each of them with its own profile, but at the same time one community.Next summer, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess and their children will visit the Faroe Islands. I know that the Crown Prince and the Crown Princess are looking forward to meeting again the impressive scenery, the rich cultural life and the generous hospitality. I am very pleased that also my grandchildren will now enjoy the experiences that have meant so much to me.There is economic prosperity in the Faroe Islands these years, entrepreneurship is booming and the population is growing. We can all take pleasure in that.I send my warmest New Year greetings to everybody in the Faroe Islands.In Greenland, the stunning scenery makes a deep impression on everybody who visits the country.“How delightful it is to hearthe lament of the icewhen it begins to break upthe shining armour beginning to crackthe first days of spring!”My husband writes this in his poem “Ode to Greenland”. Like me, he has been deeply impressed by Greenland and the nature of Greenland since his first visit many years ago now. But nature in Greenland can be ruthless, it also has destructive power.Last summer, a tsunami hit the two settlements of Nuugaatsiaq and Illorsuit. \\xa0Families lost their love ones, and many saw their livelihoods destroyed. It was a difficult time during which the community showed its importance and all joined forces to help.Tonight, I send my heartfelt thoughts to all those affected by the tsunami. I wish everybody in Greenland a happy New Year.In many situations, it is necessary that we help each other. Tonight, most Danes are off duty. But there are also many who are at work because they take care of others. At hospitals, nursing homes and institutions, staff are on duty round the clock and all the days of the year. This is also the case tonight.The Fire Brigade, the Emergency Management Agency, the Police, and the Defence are also ready to respond to any call for help. For them, New Year’s Eve is no different from all other nights.I send my warm New Year greetings to all of them.Also this year, there are Danish soldiers, police officers and specialists who are posted far from home. They contribute to creating security and stability in the places where they serve.The Crown Princess has told me about her visit to the soldiers in Mali where they help protect the civilian population, and Prince Joachim could tell about our soldiers’ efforts in Iraq.Also in the new year, we will continue the efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Danish Defence will also participate in intensified efforts in the Baltic Region.I send New Year greetings to all those who from postings abroad keep all of us safe and secure at home.Tonight, I also think of the Danes who live all over the world, and of the many who have their roots in Denmark. I am deeply moved by their loyalty to their old country every time I experience it. I extend my warmest New Year greetings to them all.I also send my New Year greetings to the Danish minority in South Schleswig. There, the Danish spirit continues to be alive as part of everyday life.The fact that there is room to blossom for Danish national identity south of the border is in my eyes a reflection of friendship, respect and good neighbourly relations between Danes and Germans. I also take pleasure in the many associations and institutions that contribute to forging strong links across the border.I wish all Danes south of the border a happy New Year.Lastly, together with all my family I wish to say thank you to everybody for the old year.It is a pleasure for the Crown Prince and Crown Princess, Prince Joachim, Princess Marie and their children that so many take an active and lively interest in all that happens in the young generations.In some ways, this has not been an easy year for me and my family. Therefore, we have been deeply touched by the sympathy and understanding extended to Prince Henrik by so very many people. We are very grateful for that. It makes everyday life easier for all of us.Life goes up and down. The most important thing is that we have people who are close to us.Therefore, I send my New Year greetings here tonight to all those who have experienced hard times in the old year and to each and every one who must sit alone.My wish is that the new year will bring hope and joy to everybody.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 GOD BLESS DENMARK',\n",
              " 'Her Majesty The Queen’s New Year Address 2016Right now only a few hours remain of the old year, 2016. Very soon we will write 2017 – a new year with new opportunities, but also with the tasks and problems we did not manage to complete or solve in the old year. Writing 2017 instead of 2016 will not make our concerns disappear.During the past year, we have witnessed terrorist attacks that have filled us with fear and horror. But we have learnt that we must not allow ourselves to be paralysed by fear. Life must go on. We must persevere and not lose heart. \\xa0There is good reason here to say thank you to all those who make an effort to ensure our safety and security. They have assumed a responsibility which they, naturally, are under an obligation to undertake, but which they carry out with commitment and care. They are always prepared, and they contribute to ensuring that we can maintain the joy of life. \\xa0For we will not abandon the joy of life.War and poverty have made many flee their home countries to seek refuge, also in Denmark. We take care of people who need help and many stand ready to help them settle and create a new life in this, to them, very strange country. They have expectations of their new life – and we have expectations of them. Refugees need to understand the country they have arrived in: A country where not only the climate is completely different, but where the way of life and the customs are different and have a long history and deep roots.It is not easy to settle in a foreign country. It is hard work that requires good will and an open mind.Many new Danes have experienced this first-hand. They have worked with great determination to learn the Danish language and get to know Danish traditions. They have found jobs and they see to it that their children get a good start in life. They have gained a foothold here and feel at home in Denmark. They have become part of our community.They have good reason to be apprehensive of being affected by the scepticism that may arise when new large numbers of refugees stream into Denmark and when some find it difficult to find their place in Denmark; but they should not suffer if others do not make the same effort to become part of the Danish community.Exactly this aspect, to be part of the Danish community, is of great importance. It is not something that can be asked for, but it is something that comes almost unnoticeably little by little. It is there when “they” becomes “we” and “them” becomes “us” – the Danes, we Danes!What does it mean to be Danish? Do we need to be Danish? Does nationality play any role at all in modern industrialised global society?What a question to ask!After all, we are Danes; but we are also different. We have a different background, we have a different upbringing. We come from a big city, we come from a small community, but each and every one of us knows that we are Danish. This is part of our identity.Perhaps we feel it most strongly when we return to Denmark after a long journey: The signposting is in Danish – and the number plates – the weather? Well, but that is what we are used to. The language – indeed, it is an integral part of ourselves. We have listened to Danish and spoken it from childhood. It is the joy of recognition we experience. This, to the same extent as our habits and customs, is part of being Danish.* * *Denmark is a small country where it is easy to get from one place to another. But we are also a society where people are very busy. The children go to school, both parents have a job, holiday plans must be made; it can be difficult to see even the neighbours next door – the other families living in flats in the same building, or those a bit further down the road, colleagues at work. We see ourselves as very friendly and outgoing people who find it easy to smile and make small talk. But we must not ignore the self-sufficiency which may also characterise us Danes.Let us make a New Year’s resolution for 2017! Let us try to see the people who surround us. Let us bear in mind also to notice those we do not know already. “How are things over there?” Is there a need for a helping hand, some care, or just a “good morning” by way of recognition, a nod to the person we are queuing with at the tills?We sometimes feel lonely, also in the hustle and bustle of our everyday lives.* * *During my trips on board the Royal Yacht Dannebrog, I have visited very different parts of the country. There are places where the wheels are spinning, the business sector is flourishing, and everybody I encounter takes great pride in their work. There are other places where conditions are more difficult. It is clearly problematic for them to make ends meet and to keep up their spirits. Nevertheless, it is the smiles and the warm welcome I receive everywhere that I remember most clearly. Also where the problems may seem huge, there are people with fresh ideas, with entrepreneurial spirit; sometimes as an act of defiance.Here on the threshold of the New Year, optimism is gaining ground and the economy is growing. Now is the time that we need people with ideas and enterprise everywhere.Denmark cannot function without all those who make an effort in production. This applies to large as well as small manufacturing companies, and to the agricultural sector; and it applies to those who transport goods from one end of the country to another, and sell the goods to their customers, or to those who have a completely different function in our society.Job satisfaction is altogether fundamental to our everyday lives. It is job satisfaction that makes staff as well as managers make the extra effort; job satisfaction sets the wheels spinning and leads to the unified entity which is our well-functioning Danish society. Our society which we take pride in.* * *This year the Olympic Games were held in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. It was a great pleasure for me to meet with many of the participants, both from the Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games here in autumn after their return to Denmark. Their efforts were exemplary – and nerve-racking – and they are good role models for young as well as elderly people. Their fine results did us all proud.\\xa0* *\\xa0*Aarhus has been designated as the European Capital of Culture 2017. This is a source of pleasure to us all. I have so many good memories from the time when I lived and studied in Aarhus – in my youth a great many years ago. The Crown Prince also studied in Aarhus and got his master’s there. We go there in summer as well as in winter and our family often celebrate Easter and Christmas in Aarhus.I wish to congratulate everybody in Aarhus and in the region on the task of Capital of Culture and I wish you good luck with the performance of this task – and I hope the rest of us will enjoy all the events in the coming year. I am looking forward to visiting Aarhus. The city has much to offer, also to the rest of the world.* * *Also this year, Danes posted abroad have made a great effort.Many serve in distant places where they risk their lives and limbs in the fight for peace. They bring new hope to people who through no fault of their own have lost everything in bloody conflicts – their loved ones, their homes and their livelihood.Danish soldiers are training the Iraqi forces on the ground in Iraq, and in Afghanistan they continue to train the country’s own soldiers. The Crown Prince has visited our soldiers posted in Iraq and in Mali. There he had the opportunity to thank them in person for their great and effective efforts.The Air Force continues to be involved in the fight against terrorism in the Middle East where they make a very valuable contribution. It is very demanding for pilots as well as personnel on the ground.The Navy has headed the task of transporting the remains of Libya’s chemical weapons stockpiles from the country, a necessary and reassuring task which they have performed at the same time as they carry out their important task of sovereignty enforcement and maritime rescue service at sea in the North Atlantic and in all Danish waters.Tonight, I send my thank you to all of them, in Denmark, and wherever they serve throughout the world, for their good and professional effort and I wish each and every one of them a happy New Year.* * *Throughout the world there are many people of Danish origin. They are well-integrated and many are nationals of the country in which they live, but they still feel Danish and they are good representatives of Danish values. I wish them a happy New Year, we are proud of them, here in their country of origin.Danes in South Schleswig constitute a special group of people living outside Denmark. Tonight, I send my warmest New Year greetings to them. It is always a great pleasure for me to see that so many associations, institutions and private homes uphold Danish culture, tradition and history.* * *On this last evening of the year, I wish to send my greetings and thanks to the many professional people as well as the many volunteers who during the holiday season contribute to making Christmas and New Year festive, also for those who are on their own, while others are celebrating.I also wish to say thank you and send New Year greetings to all those who see to it that we are safe and secure in our everyday lives as well as on a festive evening like tonight. This applies to the Police and the Defence, the Danish Emergency Management Agency and those who are on duty tonight, at hospitals among others.* * *It was a great pleasure for me to travel to the Faroe Islands again last summer. As always, it was a wonderful experience to receive the warm and friendly welcome of the Faroese people. I got a clear impression of the enterprise which the Faroese people demonstrate and of the ensuing results. It is clearly visible both in terms of business and trade and everywhere in the thriving cultural life of these beautiful islands.I send my warmest greetings and best wishes for a happy New Year to everybody in the Faroe Islands.* * *Also this year we have experienced the increased interest in Greenland. The breath-taking nature of Greenland is impressive and attracts visitors from the entire world. Nature is Greenland’s unique treasure house; but Greenland lies exposed. Climate change is clearly felt, and increased international interest in the Arctic region makes many turn their attention to Greenland. I am very conscious of the challenge experienced by Greenland right now, and tonight I wish to send my very best wishes for the New Year to everybody in Greenland.* * *In the year ahead, Prince Henrik and I can celebrate our golden wedding anniversary. We have decided to celebrate the occasion very quietly with our sons, daughters-in-law, and grandchildren. These 50 years have been full of tasks that have given us much joy and pleasure. We and our family always meet with a warm and caring reception. It fills us with gratitude.Also the Crown Prince and the Crown Princess and Prince Joachim and Princess Marie meet with this attention. They all add their greetings and best wishes together with Prince Henrik and me when I tonight wish you all a happy New Year with a thank you for the year that has come to an end.\\xa0GOD BLESS DENMARK',\n",
              " \"Her Majesty The Queen's New Year Address 2015A year is coming to an end; tomorrow a new year will begin.We cannot take leave of 2015 without reflecting upon what the year has brought with it. In January we saw first the shocking attack on the French satirical magazine in Paris, and about a month later we experienced the two attacks at Krudttønden and at the Synagogue in Krystalgade in Copenhagen. Two Danes lost their lives, and we were all left with a sense of shock and horror – acts of terrorism had reached us. My thoughts go to the relatives of both victims. We were all affected, which was reflected in the huge rally of support shown in the days and weeks following the tragic events.But it was not to end there: Not many weeks ago, Paris was hit once again by terrorist attacks leaving many people dead and injured. Not only Europe – but the entire world has demonstrated solidarity with France. Acts of terrorism are not a European phenomenon. Terrorists strike at innocent people everywhere, people who are merely going about their day-to-day ordinary business.We are affected, too, and we must understand and consider that no man is an island; we are all a part of the main.Our reaction must not become one of paralysing fear. We must adjust to our conditions as they are, we must exercise vigilance. But we must live our every-day lives in confidence and in good spirits – in high spirits, indeed, for fear makes us weak.It is no news that there is war and misery and terrorism throughout the world. We have been able to follow this every day in newspapers and on television: horrifying pictures of other people’s misfortune. Nevertheless, up to now it has only affected us in a strangely noncommittal manner until we this year have seen people in distress and entire families desperately trying to reach Europe, and also entering our country in larger numbers than ever before.Many refugees have sought protection in Denmark and it is our responsibility to render assisstance. It is a huge task, but also a difficult dilemma: How many can we help, and how do we help in the best way? My wish is that the New Year will prove a good year for all those who find their place in Denmark.I also wish to use this evening to send my greetings to the many authorities, organisations and individuals who are making a great and essential effort to render assistance to the people arriving in Denmark, and who perform the tasks ensuing from this.* * *The distress and suffering of others casts new light on the lives we lead in Denmark. Our lives are safe and secure. There is cohesion between our hopes and the opportunities we all have. Hectic, that is what our time has come to be for many of us, and this may make “the old days” look romantic and carefree; but they were not like that. Most people had a much tougher day-to-day life some two or three generations ago. At that time, there was good reason for worry and concern. We understand very well that we cannot put carefree trust in the future, but we must not paint the future as doom and gloom.We are healthier and fitter than previous generations. We live longer, we have more leisure time and more opportunities to spend it. In short, we are extremely privileged compared with the world at large. Nevertheless, it sometimes looks as if more people worry more about less. Do we eat too much? Do we eat healthy enough? Are the instructions for use understandable? How to make our mark so that everybody can see how important we are, each and every one? How will we cope when we grow old – and live to a great old age; that is what we want. We should notice that most of us are healthier and fitter than our parents or grandparents were.We should probably not worry so much about our children either. We cannot hold their hands forever. We must give them room and not protect them so zealously that they do not get the chance to learn any lessons of their own. Previously, children were left to play on their own, without any interference from adults and with plenty of room for imagination. Sometimes they would fall and hurt themselves, and sometimes it might be a bit difficult to explain how the trousers had got torn or what had happened to the hair bow. “Up you get” the grown-ups would say – and the children managed. It meant lessons learnt, which they might well have preferred to do without, but that is part of life itself.Nobody goes through life without encountering obstacles. As time goes by, the challenges appear: at school, during further education, at our workplace. It is important that we should encounter challenges when we are young. Some challenges are dealt with successfully, others prove too daunting. But that must not lead to a sense of despondency. By contrast, that is when we need to find out what to do next.We cannot all do the same. We must not, at all costs, do what all the others do. On the other hand, nor should we strive so hard to be unique that it impacts negatively on our fellowship and solidarity with others.* * *This year, the Prince Consort and I have visited Greenland once again. A two-week trip which the wonderful summer weather contributed to making yet another unforgettable meeting with the Land of Human Beings. We revisited many places, but we also experienced settlements we had not previously visited. Everywhere we encountered so much warmth that the sun seemed to shine even where the sky was cloudy. Both of us want to say: Thank you for last summer, and we wish all Greenland society a happy New Year.For the Faroe Islands, this has been a good year. Nature has been in a generous mood and there is much enterprise and activity among the Faroese. The Prince Consort and I had looked forward to our visit, which unfortunately had to be given up; but we send our warmest greetings and best wishes for the New Year to everybody in the Faroe Islands. And I want to add: See you next summer!* * *The past year has presented us with many challenges, not least for the Police. I wish to say thank you for the effort; it has not been costless, not for individuals and not for the entire police force as such. I wish you a happy New Year with my warm thanks for what each and every one has contributed.I also send my New Year greetings to all Danes posted abroad who in the course of this year have performed dangerous tasks throughout the world.They have all made an honourable effort on behalf of Denmark, and I wish to send them a special thank you. Specialists from the Danish Emergency Management Agency have rendered assistance in Nepal after the devastating earthquakes. In West Africa, where the Ebola epidemic has claimed so many victims, Danish doctors and nurses have made a fearless effort so that the countries affected are now able to handle the terrible disease.Denmark is aware of its international responsibility and that is why the Danish Defence also this year has been active in many hotspots throughout the world. Everywhere, we hear words of praise for the efforts of the Danish forces. This applies to the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. We can take pride in that. I wish to thank all who have been posted abroad.I wish all of you, both those at home and those who are abroad right now, a happy New Year.Tonight, I also send my greetings and thoughts to all Danes, wherever they are throughout the world. A thank you for their effort and a wish for a happy New Year for themselves and their activity. I also send my greetings to Danes in South Schleswig. Like the German minority north of the border, they contribute to making our border area a model for other border areas. I wish them all a happy New Year.I cannot end my address without saying thank you, a thank you for all the warmth and kindliness that the Prince Consort and I and all our family have received also this year.Tonight, however, I would like to extend my best thanks to the Prince Consort. My husband has made the decision that the time has now come for him to “slow down” – or, if I may use a common Danish term – to retire. Going forward, the Prince Consort will therefore only to a very limited extent partake in the official events, which for so many years have been a natural part of his life. It is his decision, which I understand and respect. I am deeply grateful for all the support, help and inspiration he has given me over the years. I look forward to continuing to carry out my duties with the support of my husband, though it will be less visible.Before us lies a new year. Tonight, we will turn yet another page: What is in store for us? We must face the future with hope, but well aware that the New Year may bring with it joy as well as sadness, challenges as well as happy moments.My wish is for everybody and for our country that the happy moments will outnumber the others, and that we will be able to respond to the challenges with confidence.With all my heart: Happy New Year 2016!GOD BLESS DENMARK\",\n",
              " 'Her Majesty The Queen’s New Year Address 2010On New Year’s Eve it is customary to look back at the year that has passed. Personally, I cannot do that without first and foremost saying thank you when I think of all the kindness and attention I have received over the year, especially in connection with my 70th birthday in April. That day has added light and joy to the entire year, which has touched and moved me much more than I can say. It was not just here in Copenhagen on the day itself, but I also experienced it throughout the country wherever I came, alone or together with my family, and it also characterised our visit to the Faroe Islands.\\xa0Even though we all may find much to take pleasure in over the past year, it has nevertheless been a year characterised by the economic crisis that has affected the world community and, consequently, also Danish society.\\xa0There is reason for concern because many have lost their jobs; shops earn less money when the customers have less money to spend; and the global scale of the crisis means that companies’ sales decrease both at home and abroad.Nevertheless, Denmark is one of the nations that have been less severely affected by the crisis.\\xa0During the crisis, we have benefited from the fact that in Denmark we have experienced prosperity and we have had savings to draw on. But what we can draw on is not only our solid material wealth. We are also wealthy in other ways. We have an established community which we take pride in. It goes very far back in our history, back to the free constitution. Indeed, it goes even further back in history because the Constitution of 1849 may be perceived as confirmation of a community that already existed.\\xa0The community is a strong quality which we should appreciate and which we need when times are not so good. Together we must draw on our ingenuity, our diligence and creative powers. These are characteristics we can draw on as we are now endeavouring to wrench ourselves out of the grips of the crisis.\\xa0When we see how others become increasingly skilful, we must not let ourselves be daunted by it, but let it be a spur to us. We must not content ourselves with what we once excelled at, but continue to use the combination of individualism and unity that has brought us this far.\\xa0Denmark has known many crises and difficult times throughout history, but together we have survived them and everybody has contributed.\\xa0But are we seeing indications these years that we have become more selfish, that we have become inclined to first and foremost make demands, and make sure that we all get what we ourselves think we are entitled to? Are we becoming distrustful of each other, and beginning to ascribe less than pure motives to each other?\\xa0If that is the case, we are not only in an economic crisis. Then it is our attitudes that are slipping. It is a crisis that is insidious because it creeps upon us and poisons our relationships with each other. It means that we are jeopardising something that may be irretrievable.\\xa0A crisis that is measurable and quantifiable, so to speak, a crisis that lends itself to figures and graphs is not nearly as serious as a crisis of values and attitudes that are faltering. We will find a way out of the present economic crisis in the short or the long term; but we must find a way out of it with our decency intact and without jeopardising our community.\\xa0In the course of the last few generations, society has developed in such a way that we can live more and more safely, both financially and socially. We have got used to being able to pick and choose quite freely in big and small matters. Our circumstances are so good now that we have almost forgotten that our decisions also have consequences and that we cannot opt into or out of all life’s conditions.\\xa0As human beings we are mutually dependent on each other. It is true today as it was yesterday and at all times. Previously, it was perhaps more obvious when people lived in small village communities where many tasks had to be performed jointly, and where several generations often lived under the same roof, and all had their tasks to perform for each other. \\xa0It was a relationship of interdependence that was obvious to everybody. Today, we have left it to society to deal with many of the obligations that were once each individual’s task. Often it goes so far that we completely forget or overlook the fact that our society is actually all of us, and that it cannot work at all if we do not each of us make an effort and feel a commitment to our loved ones as well as to those we do not come across on a daily basis.\\xa0We have achieved a freedom to shape our own lives to an extent that former generations never knew, and we should appreciate it. But we should also remember that no one is self-sufficient. Therefore, we must take care of this society, which we know as a safe framework for the individual’s activities, and we must keep eyes and ears and hearts open to our fellow men.\\xa0\\xa0On the last evening of the year when so many gather with family members and friends, we should not forget those who must celebrate the New Year far from Denmark. My thoughts go in particular to our soldiers in Afghanistan. They are on a mission that is extremely difficult and dangerous, but they perform it in a targeted and conscientious manner and with great courage. Both they and their relatives at home will be in our thoughts tonight. Sitting at home alone can be hard when the person one loves is far way in dangerous surroundings. I know from the Crown Prince, who visited our soldiers just before Christmas, that they approach their tasks in a spirit of seriousness and confidence, and they know that they can carry them out.\\xa0Nevertheless, the price of our effort in Afghanistan has been high: several young Danes have lost their lives, also this year. Let us remember them tonight and think of their relatives, friends and fellow soldiers who are now left with a great sense of loss.\\xa0Some of our soldiers have returned badly wounded and others are mentally scarred by their experiences. It applies to all of them that they deserve all our care and recognition. In the autumn, I had the opportunity to meet some of our wounded soldiers undergoing rehabilitation at the Copenhagen University Hospital. They all show a love of life and an incredible determination to overcome their disabilities, which made a great impression on me and which can only command admiration.\\xa0I send my New Year greetings to all Danish men and women working for our security and safety in the Armed Forces, the Emergency Management and the Police. Happy New Year to all of you at home and abroad, wherever you are.\\xa0As always at New Year, my thoughts go to the Danes who live south of the border. They are part of our Danish community. That tie has never been severed. We are proud of that.\\xa0Every year it is a great pleasure for the Prince Consort and me to visit various parts of the country. This year we also visited the Faroe Islands and we are planning a visit to Greenland on board the Dannebrog in the summer. We are looking very much forward to that, and when I send my New Year greetings to the Faroe Islands and Greenland here tonight, I also wish to say thank you for the confidence shown me and my family both in Greenland and in the Faroe Islands and for the warm ties which I feel bind us together.\\xa02010 has been a good year with many joys for my family and me. We are now looking forward to the New Year with great expectations, especially to the addition to the family, which is going to take place in January. It is a great source of joy and happiness to us all to feel the warm interest we encounter wherever we go.\\xa0In good times we must remember that good fortune is not a matter of course, and that there are always some for whom everyday life is hard. In difficult times, we must not lose heart, and a smile helps us get through the days when life seems dreary.\\xa0So let us face the New Year with confidence, and let us trust each other in big and small matters.This will be my wish for the year 2011.GOD SAVE DENMARK',\n",
              " \"Her Majesty The Queen’s New Year Address 2012It is New Year's Eve. In a few hours the Copenhagen Town Hall bells will toll. The new year 2013 is here. Of this we can be certain, and we look forward to it in hope and anticipation, but we cannot predict what it will bring us, our society, or Denmark.\\xa0We try to predict, we make estimates, we do our best not to be taken by surprise by the course of events. The new year will always be unknown territory. Therefore it is not only a matter of what will happen, but a question of how we cope with it.\\xa0We Danes have always regarded ourselves as hard-working and enterprising. The Danish society did not evolve of itself. Our society is a result of the efforts we have made through the ages to shape the future and to ensure progress: Capable tradesmen have been selling Danish goods to foreign countries. Fearless seamen have sailed all over the world. Persistent farmers have reclaimed the moors of Jutland. Industrious workers and craftsmen have played their part for Denmark to become what it is today.\\xa0That is how we have jointly developed our society and that is how we would like it to continue.\\xa0In times of crisis, difficulties may seem enormous and obstacles insurmountable, impossible to overcome. Therefore the outlook for tomorrow may seem grim for those on the sidelines, if one is left out, while the wheels are turning, and one is \\xa0unemployed or in fear of becoming so. Today, our society contributes greatly to solving these problems. We must be careful, however, not always to leave everything to society alone to straighten things out. We must begin with ourselves, with those close to us and with those we encounter along the way. Each one of us can help so much with an encouraging remark, a helping hand, respect and consideration for the other person.It has always been one of our strengths here in Denmark that we know each other inside and out and that even our geographical distances are short. The crisis in which our world finds itself today, and which is also felt in Denmark, should call for all our creativity and enterprise to the benefit of everyone and to all: for the future of our country.\\xa0\\xa0* * *In difficult times we should not only be aware of outside factors. We should also keep in mind how we personally react to each other and to ourselves.The current tendency is to imagine the perfect life with spouse, children, an inspiring job, exciting hobbies, and a youthful appearance irrespective of age. Who could hope to live up to all that? Why should we? Sooner or later we may all come up against hardship. We shall all break our necks in a crisis, if only the perfect - and superficial - life is good enough!To me, it seems that young people especially are vulnerable. The modern means of communication like the internet and Facebook offers fantastic opportunities, but can be dangerous too. The very young can so easily become addicted, that they practically live in cyberspace, so that life is lived in a parallel universe in a display window, in which appearances are more important than essence. But the young generation must strive to be themselves, not only as a group, but also as individuals. \\xa0It is our duty to help them along; not by paving their way, but by instilling them with confidence, so that they can manage their own lives.\\xa0\\xa0* * *Tomorrow, on January 1st, it is 40 years ago that Denmark joined the European Union. The European Union was established on the grounds of a Europe in ruins after the Second World War. It was created to recognize the need for rebuilding and cooperation across the borders.Through our entry we manifested our already existing conditions, both economically and geographically: that we are a part of the continent of Europe, that our culture, our history, our everyday life are influenced by our being a part of Europe.It was a big step for us; and it did not come about without being questioned, but it remains a fact that our continent via the European Union has enjoyed a blossoming, which everybody has benefited from, and that we have experienced increasing peace after centuries of war, unrest and mutual distrust. We must cherish these benefits.\\xa0* * *During the autumn it was a pleasure for me to make a short visit to Greenland, on the occasion of the merging of the Island Command Faroes and the Island Command Greenland into the new Arctic Command with headquarters in Nuuk. The new command is testament to our response to the new challenges and possibilities, brought about by the developments in the Arctic.\\xa0Greenland especially is facing decisions of great importance to the development of its society. This is something we must all be aware of in the North and in the South.\\xa0Certainly, thousands of miles lie between Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands, but in the Unity of the Realm our mutual connection and common history manifest themselves. My family and I have always felt a strong connection to both Greenland and the Faroe Islands. With these words I send my warmest New Year wishes and greetings to everyone in Greenland and to everyone in the Faroe Islands.\\xa0I also send my warm New Year greeting to the Danish minority in South Schleswig. Here the Danish spirit lives on. It is deeply rooted in old traditions, but clearly visible also in our time. The fact that this Danish spirit is permitted to blossom south of the border, I see as a sign of friendship, respect and good-neighbourliness between Danes and Germans.I extend my greeting and good wishes to everyone celebrating New Year far from Denmark. My greeting goes especially to our soldiers and other deployed personnel in dangerous outposts. Their great and brave contribution does Denmark credit. \\xa0I wish them and their families a Happy New Year. May they all come home safely.Tonight, my thoughts also go out to our veterans and their families. To some of them, their deployment is not a finished chapter, because they and their families must battle with the consequences of what they have been through. May the New Year bring them renewed courage and may we all take part in securing their future also.A society like ours would not function, if it were not for those, who, even on New Year’s Eve, stay at their posts to ensure safety for us all. I wish each and every one of them a Happy New Year and thank them for their efforts.\\xa0On New Year’s Eve it is customary to gather friends and family, and to reminisce about the year that has passed and what it brought us. Often we sorely miss people who are dear to us, perhaps because they are far away. But sometimes one or more are missed, because we shall never be with them again. \\xa0My New Year thoughts go to anybody, who is left with that sorrow and that loss.\\xa0To me the year 2012 has in many ways been signified by the 40 year jubilee. On the last evening of the year I would like to offer my thanks for all the kindness shown to me throughout the year, so to speak every single day. It has delighted me and warmed me more than I can say.\\xa0Throughout the year my family has felt surrounded by warm attention and sympathy. This came to the fore not the least when Prince Joachim’s and Princess Marie’s little daughter was born in January and at her christening later in the year.I wish everyone a happy and blessed New Year.\\xa0GOD BLESS DENMARK\",\n",
              " 'Her Majesty The Queen’s New Year Address 2013For most of us, the holidays around Christmas and New Year are a wonderful time of the year. They are festive days when we meet with family and friends, relax and enjoy ourselves, and take a break from everyday worries. While it is cold and dark outside with the wind sweeping around the corners of the house, we are warm and comfortable with lit candles and together with people we care for. We take the time to enjoy each other’s company. Something we forget far too easily in our day-to-day lives.\\xa0Great expectations are linked to holidays and festive occasions. Also to the New Year’s celebrations tonight. We have done the shopping and decorated our homes. And we make a great effort to ensure that neither children nor grown-ups get disappointed.Perhaps it is our great expectations that also cause tensions to rise during the holidays. In many families, Christmas and New Year are something of a puzzle to be worked out. We must be fair. Who spent Christmas with whom last year? Who is going to be where this year?It is not always easy to please everybody. Fortunately, the problems are most often solved in a friendly manner. But tensions may arise that are so serious that they cast a shadow over the family reunion.However, there are people who would gladly exchange their own problems for those I have just described. Those who find Christmas and New Year particularly difficult to cope with are people who have no family at all to argue with over these matters or whose family suffers from much heavier problems that overshadow their joy.\\xa0Tonight, I want to send my warmest New Year greetings to all those who are struggling with illness or loneliness, with misuse or homelessness.\\xa0I also wish to extend my greetings to the many that spend the holidays helping those people who are most in need. They have experienced how much it may mean to us personally when we contribute to the happiness of others. Their efforts are invaluable and they deserve recognition and gratitude from us all.* * *Denmark is a country with many different people. We are young or old or somewhere in between. Some live in the countryside, some in towns. Some have lived here all their lives, others have arrived not so long ago. But we are part of the same community and that is why we share conditions in all matters, large and small, for better or for worse. We must distinguish between large and small problems. It is true that Denmark is a small country, but we must take care not to become a small-minded country.\\xa0And if we bear that in mind, we will understand that we must solve our problems by bending towards each other. If one branch alone has to bend, it may break.\\xa0We must not put a lid on discussions. We must dare take the necessary debates. It may be at our workplace, at school or where we live. That is a good beginning. The next step is for us to listen to what others say. Then we may have a discussion to make us wiser. It requires courage to enter into a debate – but also to show generosity of spirit.\\xa0* * *Our modern lives give us many advantages that we would not want to do without. We enjoy a degree of freedom and prosperity unknown to previous generations. But development comes at a price.\\xa0It is as if personal contact is being lost in our busy and preoccupied lives today. All those modern facilities meant to make life easier also make it more complicated and make increasing demands on us for what we are to achieve and perform. We are concerned about future climate change, and so we should be. But sometimes we forget to enjoy a lovely day, the sun and the wind, and the changing seasons. We are concerned about problems on the other side of the world and of course this is important. But do we have the awareness to help the family next door who we know may need it?\\xa0* * *We worry over today’s problems, both for ourselves and for the world at large. Let us nevertheless take a look at the past. Let us remember a period of time that was truly critical for our country and our society.70 years ago during the Jewish New Year in October, Danish Jews had to flee. In the middle of their New Year celebrations, otherwise quite normal workdays, they had to break up and flee in all haste. All of a sudden, families, children and old people found themselves in a terrible crisis. They were forced to make their escape across the waters of the Øresund in small fishing vessels, hidden away in damp and confined holds with the fear of death as their travelling companion. These are experiences which have never been forgotten and which make a strong impression also on all of us that have only been told about them. But what happened then is also something we can take pride in remembering, and we must continue to cherish the memory of it. It was then that Denmark showed its strength as a community, as men and women from all walks of life \\xa0 individually and spontaneously looked for solutions; organising escape routes, providing food and shelter – without consideration for their own safety.\\xa0Today, Danes are still individuals with varying outlooks. We are not all of us rooted in the same religion or culture. However, as was the case 70 years ago, differences must not be allowed to prevent us from helping our neighbours and fellow countrymen – from person to person.* * *The Danish Realm of today comprises different peoples with different cultures and with their separate languages. This we recognise and respect.\\xa0But we are also bound together through our long history and we must stand guard over all that we have in common and that unites us.\\xa0As the ice off Greenland starts to melt, new prospects open for shipping routes in waters never navigable before. At the same time, new opportunities appear for tapping into the rich resources of that country to the benefit of both employment and revenue. But this development also implies a huge responsibility for all who become involved. This applies to maritime safety as well as to the vulnerable natural environment of Greenland.\\xa0Faroese society has already experienced part of the development which Greenland society is now facing. But as is the case for Greenland, the Faroe Islands are constantly dependent on natural resources and the international community’s market conditions. Of this they are fully aware. I am convinced that the Faroe Islands also in future will be able to demonstrate the resilience and innovativeness required to navigate under the given conditions.\\xa0We all feel the strongly increased international interest in the North Atlantic area. This interest faces both Greenland and the Faroe Islands with decisions of far-reaching significance, and it will have implications for each individual society as well as for the Danish Realm as such.I wish to send my warmest New Year wishes and greetings to everybody in Greenland and to everybody in the Faroe Islands. It is with great pleasure that I think of the many times my family and I have visited these parts of the Realm that are so very close to our hearts. And it is with much gratitude that I think of the warm hospitality which we always enjoy.\\xa0Also the Danes in South Schleswig are linked to Denmark with strong ties of the heart. I am always very happy to see that so many hold on to Danish culture and tradition and I wish to extend my hopes for a happy New Year to the many associations and institutions and to all Danish homes.\\xa0This year again, there are Danish soldiers and other personnel posted to dangerous parts of the world. We all wish to see them returning safe and sound. I wish to thank all of them for their contribution. Both the Crown Prince and Prince Joachim have visited them, in Kosovo as well as in Afghanistan. They are, like me, deeply impressed with their contributions. Although the Danish presence will be gradually reduced in 2014, it does not close the chapter for them all. Some must live on with both physical and mental wounds. Let us not forget them. I wish every single person at home and abroad a happy New Year.\\xa0On New Year’s Eve, many Danes throughout the world follow New Year’s celebrations in Denmark. I wish each and everyone, across all time zones, a happy New Year.To everybody who must be on duty tonight to ensure that our society remains safe and secure I also send my best New Year’s greetings and my gratitude for their work in the course of the year.Last but not least I wish to thank you for the year that has passed. This comes from the Prince Consort and myself as well as from our entire family. We thank you for all your kind attention and for the many heart-warming meetings and greetings we have received throughout this year.The year 2013 is drawing to an end. What the New Year may bring none of us knows, but let us step into it together in a spirit of hope and confidence.I wish each and every one of you a happy New Year 2014.\\xa0\\xa0GOD BLESS DENMARK',\n",
              " \"Her Majesty The Queen's New Year Address 2014Tonight is New Year’s Eve. Behind us lies a whole year of happiness and sadness. For most people, it is the happy moments that stand out most clearly. For others, the sad moments loom largest when looking back.\\xa0But before us lies a whole new year, which we already fill with expectations and wishes. “What you wish for, you shall have” are the words of the old Christmas song that many of us have sung. But we know very well that it is not that easy. We expect so much. Perhaps we should rather remember to expect something from each other.\\xa0If we have no expectations whatsoever of another person, if we only say: “You can’t possibly manage that”, it is in the air that it probably will not lead to anything. For even though some people react by thinking to themselves “I’ll prove them wrong if it’s the last thing I do”, it may be those words that are the last straw. Saying we do not expect anything, we have perhaps contributed to ruining another person’s future.\\xa0We must have expectations of our fellow human beings just as we wish that people expect something from us. It is a matter of trusting each other, of believing in the opportunities for each other.\\xa0Therefore, we must talk things up, instead of talking them down.\\xa0It starts already in school. Don’t we all remember our time at school? It has left its imprint on us all. Most of us remember a teacher who was particularly good at bringing out the best in every one of us in the class. There is always a need for these teachers, and there are still a great many of these teachers. Right now it is the Christmas holiday; but children and teachers must soon start school again. I wish all of you children who are watching tonight a very happy New Year. After the holiday you will go back to school; then you must show how much progress you can make.\\xa0The time will also come when you leave school. What to do then? Should you go for a university degree? Should you become a school teacher? Should you perhaps learn a trade? Become a good carpenter, a skilled mechanic; use your abilities to do something with your hands. Start your own small enterprise or look for a job at a major workplace with many other competent employees.\\xa0No matter what you choose, you must make an effort. The first step is the hardest, but it is a great pleasure when it turns out right.\\xa0It is my hope that 2015 will be a year in which many young people wish to make an effort – and are successful – also when it is a matter of difficult tasks.\\xa0\\xa0* * *We live in an affluent society. We need not worry about having enough to eat, rather the opposite. Our country is wealthy even though we have experienced years of economic crisis. We are safer here in Denmark than in most other places throughout the world.\\xa0Naturally, this is good; but our prosperity must not become a pretext for doing nothing. We must not become so complacent that we do not demand enough of ourselves and each other. On the contrary, we must continue to strive for new knowledge, new skills and new insight. We must continue to do our best. That is the way to keep and develop our affluent and safe society.This applies to young people just as it applies to all of us. We must make an effort. We must do our best in all aspects of life, also when others need help. Perhaps it is a colleague who needs attention and kindness, just a friendly word, a smile on a dreary day or a helping hand to show that we care about each other. We may also witness how somebody is harassed or bullied. In such cases, it is tempting to think: “I don’t want to get involved. What can I do? Others will have to deal with that.” But if nobody does anything and all sit on the fence, nothing will change for the better. We ourselves may also need another human being to stop and give us a hand.\\xa0\\xa0* * *In the course of the past year we have seen how unrest and uncertainty has spread in many places throughout the world in a way that gives rise to concern. This has also affected countries that are not very far from us. We see patterns emerge that disturbingly bring to mind periods of time we do not wish to experience again. No wonder we are concerned; but we must not take fright. We must hold on to the values that are essential for us – both for our welfare and our safety.\\xa0One of the consequences of the present situation is the huge wave of refugees that we see today and which we also experience at close quarters in Denmark.\\xa0Recently, thousands of refugees have come to Denmark, very many from the horrifying and protracted civil war in Syria. Everywhere throughout this country, a major effort is being made to help the refugees. The task may seem daunting – to receive so many people from foreign countries and different cultures.\\xa0Danish municipalities are facing a huge task, large as well as small municipalities. They receive much help from voluntary organisations and the many individuals who make an effort to render practical assistance and to introduce refugees to Danish society. It is not enough to take care of them, we must also help them to feel at home in society so that they can gain a foothold and manage on their own.\\xa0Help alone is not enough. We must also encourage newly arrived persons to build a new existence where they can take responsibility for themselves and do their best to feel at ease in the foreign country, be it for a long or a short period of time.\\xa0I wish to thank all those who have involved themselves in rendering assistance. I wish them a happy New Year and I also wish those who have arrived here a happy New Year and a good start here.\\xa0\\xa0* * *In the past year, Greenland has experienced both political turbulence and economic challenges. This was not envisaged only a year ago. We all hope that the New Year will prove a new beginning for Greenland society. In spite of all difficulties, the warmth and high spirits of the people in Greenland has not changed. This was perfectly obvious during the visit of the Crown Prince and his family to Greenland last summer. For the Crown Prince and the Crown Princess it was a happy revisit, and for their children it was an experience they will never forget, an experience that will bring them back to Greenland time and again. It warmed the hearts of us who, as parents and grandparents, could follow the journey from a distance. Together with the Prince Consort I wish to thank everybody in Greenland for the hospitable reception the Crown Prince and his family enjoyed everywhere.\\xa0The past year has not been a bad year for the Faroe Islands. There is plenty of initiative and drive among the Faroese. They know the conditions presented by nature and they have got a good grip on the challenges facing them from the international community.\\xa0Together with the Prince Consort I send my warmest New Year wishes and greetings to everybody in the Faroe Islands and to everybody in Greenland. Next summer, both of us will visit the Faroe Islands as well as Greenland; we are looking forward to that with great expectations.\\xa0\\xa0* * *On 18 April this year, the whole country commemorated the attack on the Dybbøl position in 1864 and the defeat which left its mark on Denmark in matters large and small. Also this year, we commemorate the centennial of the outbreak of World War I, the war that left its blood-stained mark on most European countries, but which Denmark was not involved in. However, the outcome of that war was also the reason why the people of South Jutland were able to vote for reunification with Denmark in 1920. A deep wound was going to heal.\\xa0Still, this did not apply to all with pro-Danish sympathies. Those in South Schleswig were not included. “You will not be forgotten” said King Christian X at the new border at Kruså when he met with Danish-minded people from South Schleswig during the celebrations of the Reunification in 1920. “You have not been forgotten” we can say today even though your fate turned out differently. You have held on to your Danish heritage for generations, and you have added a feature to the border country that is unique among border areas worldwide. I wish to send my warmest New Year greetings to everyone in South Schleswig.\\xa0\\xa0* * *Every year, Denmark sends many people to distant places in the world. This applies to our soldiers who in Afghanistan and Iraq help to train these countries’ own soldiers. It applies to our seamen who have transported toxic chemicals away from Syria, or who have been on patrol off the Horn of Africa. Also the Danish Air Force is active in the airspace over Iraq. Others are, or have been, sent abroad to provide emergency relief assistance of various kinds. Here I wish to mention in particular the Danish doctors and nurses who have agreed to be sent to Africa to engage in the fight against the terrible Ebola epidemic. The effort they are prepared to make deserves our highest praise. On this New Year’s Eve, I wish to thank them all for their selfless effort and wish them and other Danes posted abroad, wherever they are in the world, a happy New Year.\\xa0I wish to send my New Year greetings to all who are struggling with illness, grief and difficult problems. It can be particularly hard on a New Year’s Eve when others are celebrating and are happy. May the New Year bring you all comfort and new courage.\\xa0\\xa0* * *Many Danes celebrate the New Year outside Denmark. Whether they are near or far away, whether they have left home for a short period of time or have settled more permanently abroad, I wish them a happy New Year. They contribute to making Denmark known throughout the world.\\xa0For me and my family, this year has brought us so many joys. I am thinking of our visits to various parts of the country and of the attention the Prince Consort received on his 80th birthday. It has warmed his heart, just as it has warmed the hearts of all our family. A heartfelt thank you!May the New Year 2015 bring much good with it! To each and every one of you, to all families and to our country.\\xa0GOD BLESS DENMARK\",\n",
              " 'A year has 365 days; this is the same for everyone, but how different it seems to a child or a young person, to an adult or elderly person. There is a long time till Christmas, a whole year until one’s birthday, and an eternity till the summer holidays. Later in life, time passes much faster; it feels as if summer has just ended when New Year’s Eve is here; over and over again. \\xa0However, regardless of your age, a new year will always be a year of opportunities. As one grows older, experience may become a mental ballast when faced with a new year and new times, whether hardship or optimism prevail. \\xa0* * *These are troubled times. The global economic crisis is evident to all, not least here in Europe, where we face major problems, which affect all aspects of society.In current times it has become increasingly obvious that all parts of the world rely on each other, and what happens in one place may have dire consequences elsewhere. This has become particularly apparent in Europe in recent years. In many parts of the world, growth has stagnated, which is worrying, also for Denmark, though we are not the most affected. Employment opportunities disappear as workplaces have to close down. Many are concerned for their own and their family’s future.The current situation is also worrying for the younger generation. They often fail to get started as they struggle to find job opportunities, or to get the education which would improve their chances of employment. \\xa0This may shake their confidence, which further jeopardises their attempts at finding a foothold and moving on. This is a serious situation; not just for the young person in question, but for society as a whole. It is after all this next generation that must lead our society in the future; we depend on them.When times are uncertain, we too may become unsure of ourselves and doubt whether our skills are sufficient for the tasks ahead. We become hesitant towards accepting challenges, which is understandable; though this must not lead to an inability to act.As a community we must not immerse ourselves in our worries, but rather face up to the problems and do something about them.We have experienced difficult times before, and have witnessed how mustering our strength, supporting one another and not giving up have led us through to better times. Fellowship is a cornerstone of our society, yet fellowship can only be found where each one of us is ready to contribute.We must not leave it to others – or to chance – how to proceed. It must be our own responsibility to find a starting point; both mentally and physically.If misfortune makes it impossible to find employment in a preferred field, pursuing other options may be the answer; after all, many have done so before. For the young generation, it may be a question of changing course, if one’s first-choice study is not available. Perhaps one should move to another town or region, if employment or education options are better there. In Denmark we have the privilege of many options and opportunities, perhaps because we are a small country, both in size and population. Yet it requires personal effort to discover these opportunities and to take advantage of them.* * *Tomorrow, Denmark will take the chair of the EU. This at a time when the global and European economic situation is in a critical phase. Great demands will be placed on our ability to organise this event. We must demonstrate what we are capable of; but I have no doubt that we will rise to this occasion.To everyone involved with Denmark’s chairmanship, whether involved in a major or minor capacity, I wish you the best of luck.We all remember how, as children, we saw the future and the world as a place and time of opportunities. We want to develop as a human being, to thrive and to provide joy and benefits to our community. Still, for some it may go awry; they may encounter challenges, which exceed their strength; or they find themselves in serious trouble, from which they cannot escape without help. They lose their grip on life, so to speak.In spite of the many initiatives our society offers to help and support, recovery can be such a monumental task that some give up. They withdraw into themselves. Not least during Christmas and New Year is it hard to feel left out. Tonight my thoughts are with them.* * *Denmark is a pleasant and safe society. Throughout the country we have dedicated people, who contribute greatly through their professional work in hospitals, care facilities, schools and kindergartens. They take on an immense responsibility and administer it competently and humanely.But we cannot place all responsibility with the public sector, or expect that all our problems can be resolved through legislation. We all have a joint responsibility.Many have accepted such a responsibility through voluntary work – either as part of nationwide organisations, or through smaller local initiatives, or by simply lending a helping hand where it is needed. This provides more value than we might appreciate. To these volunteers I send my sincere thanks and blessings for the New Year.Every day of the year there are some who must be awake and be prepared to act when called upon. I extend my New Year’s blessings to the Civil Defence Force and the Police Force, who help to ensure that daily life in Denmark can proceed safely and peacefully.* * *One of the past year’s most memorable experiences for me was visiting our soldiers in the Helmand province in Afghanistan. We are all aware of their outstanding, professional effort, but to observe personally how they live, to speak with them and to gain an insight into their everyday life, is something I shall never forget. Tonight I send them my warmest New Year’s blessings and best wishes.Again this year Danish soldiers have served in many of the world’s hotspots. Everywhere they have earned great respect and admiration amongst our allies. I wish to seize this opportunity to acknowledge the Danish Air Force personnel and to thank them for their extraordinary achievements in Libya.On September 5th this year, “The Monument for Denmark’s International Effort” was unveiled at Kastellet. It serves as a place of remembrance in honour of our fallen and veterans, and to recognise their loved ones, who must suffer the consequences of Denmark’s engagement.My family and I wish all personnel deployed abroad, and their families, a Happy New Year. You are all in our thoughts.* * *This past summer, the Prince Consort and I travelled to Greenland for an extended visit. From north to south we were met everywhere with heart-warming hospitality, which added to the fond memories we have from previous trips over many years. It is a great joy to witness the enthusiasm with which the community in Greenland is developing, despite the fact that times are not the easiest. Along with our family, the Prince Consort and I wish the people of Greenland a Happy New Year, and we extend our thanks for the year that has passed.My New Year’s greetings and good wishes also reach out to the Faroe Islands. The Prince Consort and I still remember our visit last year vividly and with great pleasure.On this evening I send a warm greeting to all Danes living outside of our country’s borders, and to the many, who have maintained ties to their Danish homeland – in some cases through generations. This also applies to the South Schleswigers, whose Danish sentiments link them so strongly to Denmark. I wish you all a happy New Year.2011 began with a joyous occasion; the birth of the Crown Prince Couple’s twins, Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine. We now look forward to the approaching birth of Prince Joachim and Princess Marie’s second child. We are delighted and touched by the sincere interest in our family shown to us by all. I wish all families could experience as many happy moments as we do in mine; to see their children grow up and mature, and their grandchildren thrive and spread joy. Yet we all know that life may turn out very differently, and that we may encounter rocks and obstacles, which may tax the courage of the best.During difficult times it is especially important that we look out for one another and that we be ready to encourage and offer support wherever we can.Let us enter the New Year knowing that we can be therefor each other. God bless you all; \\xa0GOD BLESS DENMARK\\xa0\\xa0']"
